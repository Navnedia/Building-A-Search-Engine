# Building a Search Engine

> **Warning** work in progress!

A basic search engine that helps you index a corpus to search and rank the document data set. Built using Python and object-oriented programming principles to make the project extendable and maintainable.

**Features:**
- **Inverted Index** - to improve search times.
- **Results Ranking** - with term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to order results by relevance.
- **Query Expansion** - to automatically add additional query terms (like synonyms) to improve results relevancy **([see my testing analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2MKWVXAzkRehzV31ugEjfnJod2w0K8gdfzscSBIvFY/edit?usp=sharing))**.
- **Result Evaluation** - test and compare results with human-evaluated  relevancy scores to gauge performance.

This started out as a course project, and I'm currently working on building this out further and adding more features to it.
I'm planning to build out a front-end web interface so I can demo this project better. I will also be adding additional 
functionality to build on the project.

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Write Documentation!
- [ ] Finish implementing stop words functionality.
- [ ] Build a frontend web interface to the demo project.
- [ ] Result snippet generation.
- [ ] Implement advanced search operators (OR, NOT).
- [ ] Improve query normalization.
- [ ] Ranking improvements.
- [ ] Add caching and on-demand loading to improve memory efficiency.


**I hope to writing some more conprehensive documentation for this project in the near future.**

Stay tuned :)
